Explain the following DCL statements in short 

GRANT 

SQL GRANT is a command used to provide access or privileges on the database objects to the users. 

REVOKE 

The REVOKE command removes user access rights or privileges to the database objects. 

 

 

Explain the types of privileges with their use. 

 

There are 2 types of privileges: 

a). Object privileges:-  These privileges are related to the existing objects in the database 

     Obj : Table, View, Procedure,  Function etc.. 

     Priv : Select , Insert, Update, Delete, Execute etc 

    Syntax :  

GRANT privileges ON Object TO User [ With Grant option ] 

 

b). System privileges:- These privileges give the right to perform a particular action the database 

 

    Create any table, alter any table, drop any table 

    Create any view, drop any view 

    Create any index, create any trigger, drop any trigger, etc 

    Syntax:  

                Grant privileges TO User [ with admin option] 

 

Explain the concept of Role in short along with it’s advantages. 

Roles are a collection of privileges or access rights. When there are many users in a database it becomes difficult to grant or revoke privileges to users. Therefore, if you define roles, you can grant or revoke privileges to users, thereby automatically granting or revoking privileges.  

 

                    Advantages: 

Reducing the number of grants and thereby making it easier to manage security. 

Dynamically changing the privileges for many users with a single grant or revoke. 

Selectively enabling or disabling depending on the application.

         Grant create any view to Role_new 

         Grant alter any table to Role_new 

         Grant drop any table to Role_new 

         Grant create any index to Role_new 

         Grant drop any index to Role_new 

         Grant Role_new to user1 

 

Explain the concept of database Transaction in short. 

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed on a database as a single logical unit of work.  

 

Explain the types of Transaction Control statements with their uses.

The main use of Commit command is to make the transaction permanent. If there is a need for any transaction to be done in the database that transaction permanent through commit command. The general syntax for the Commit command: 

COMMIT; 

 

Rollback: 

 

Using this command, the database can be restored to the last committed state. It is also used with savepoint command for jumping to a savepoint in a transaction. 

The general syntax for the Rollback command is mentioned below: 

Rollback to savepoint-name; 

 

Savepoint: 

 

The main use of the Savepoint command is to save a transaction temporarily. This way users can rollback to the point whenever it is needed. 

The general syntax for the savepoint command is mentioned below: 

savepoint savepoint-name; 

 

 

 

ASSIGNMENT NO. 9 

Create a Sequence object which will generate the unique integers from 1 to 50 to populate the primary key values in newly created table. 

  CREATE SEQUENCE seq_primarykey 

  START WITH 1 

  INCREMENT BY 1 

  MAXVALUE 50 

  NOCYCLE

Create a Synonym for above View. 

Create Synonym “DTLS” for “DISPLAY”; 

 

Explain the concept of View in short along with its advantages 

                A view can draw data from several different tables and present it as a single table, turning multi-table queries into single-table queries against the view. Views can give a user a "personalized" view of the database structure, presenting the database as a set of virtual tables that make sense for that user. 

 

Advantages over tables:  

Views can represent a subset of the data contained in a table. Consequently, a view can limit the degree of exposure of the underlying tables to the outer world: a given user may have permission to query the view, while denied access to the rest of the base table.
